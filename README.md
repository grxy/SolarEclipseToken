## What is Solar Eclipse Token?
It's the first-of-its-kind token offering based Sol-ly on a solar event. Like the 2017 solar eclipse, this offering is
a once-in-a-lifetime chance to invest in something that is as empty and vast as space itself.

## What Makes This ICO So Special?
It's the only ICO where you can get an ERC20 token that was minted during the 2017 solar eclipse.
This ICO will never happen again!

## How Many Tokens Can I Get Per ETH?
For each ether contributed, you will receive **`number of miles in an Astronomical Unit`** Solar Eclipse Tokens
(92,955,807 SET)

## Why Should I Invest?
Solar Eclipse Tokens provide zero utility and zero guarantees for going to the moon, so you definitely shouldn't.
Unless you want to buy me beer with your ether.

## Okay. I Get It. How Do I Invest Despite Your Warnings?
For just over 5 hours, as the shadow of the moon dances across the United States of America, the contract will be available to receive contributions. Details of the exact start and end time, as well as contract address are below:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is This Legit?
Absolutely! Your ETH is going to a random web citizen and you're getting some awesome pointless tokens in return!

## What Can I Do With Solar Eclipse Tokens?
You can send, receive, and HODL just like any other ERC20 token out there, but that's pretty much it.

### Is There a Limit on the Number of Solar Eclipse Tokens That Can Be Minted?
Yes! The maximum number of Solar Eclipse Tokens that can be minted is the same as the **`number of meters in an
Astronomical Unit`** (149,597,870,700 SET). But unless someone sends me around 1610 ETH, the total supply will be much, much smaller.

### How Many Tokens Are You Keeping For Yourself?
As the author of this token contract, I have chosen to keep **`speed of light in meters/second x 10`** (2,997,924,580 SET,
or ~2%) for myself.

### Do You Hope To Get SET Listed On Exchanges?
Of course! That would make me extremely happy!

### Why Are You Doing This?
I hope that some of you will make my dreams of a free ether beer or two come true!

### Any Last Suggestions?
Get outside and enjoy the solar eclipse!
